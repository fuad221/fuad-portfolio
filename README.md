## I took a ready-made website that was written in React only and with old code. And I rebuilt it again and added new techniques:
- React with Typescript.
- Redxut toolkit
- light mode and dark mode.
- Encrypt the code so that no one can get it and know the names of the inputs and outputs in the database or backend.

In the coming days we will add the api and also rebuild the project with nextjs
